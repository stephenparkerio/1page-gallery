1Page Gallery
=============

An auto-generated, simple, single-page jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, PHP photo gallery from a zip file of images.

1Page Gallery is simply the easiest photo gallery to deploy for non-programmers and developers needing to give clients a simple photo gallery with minimal footprint. The 1Page Gallery is a jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, PHP slideshow gallery which will automatically create a simple, elegant desktop and mobile-ready image gallery.

Too many slideshow plugins require significant manual configuration and editing along with managing a number of source files and assets. 1Page favors simplicity over all else. The 1Page Gallery requires deployment of 1 PHP file, 1 build script, and a zip file of your high resolution images.

Simply add the index.php, build script, and a zip of your high resolution images and a simple,
elegant jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, PHP photo gallery will be auto-magically generated. Advanced users can of course skip the zip and build step and manually create their images/ and thumbs/ directories.
